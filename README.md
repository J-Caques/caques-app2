You'll see two buttons:

	1.) New: Will bring you to the inventory screen, where you'll create a new list.

	2.) Load: Load a previous existing list, taking you to the inventory screen where you can see 	
	          and edit the list.

In the Inventory Screen you have the following actions to choose from:

	1.) +: This button allows you to add an item. A window will pop-up where you can enter the 
 	       serial number, name, and value of the item. Hit enter and it will be saved to your 	
  	       list.
	2.) -: This button allows you to remove a single item. A window will pop-up where you can 
	       either enter the item's serial number or name. Once you hit enter, that item will be 	
	       removed.

	3.) Clear: This button will erase the entire inventory in your list.

	4.) Edit: This button will allow you to edit items. A window will pop-up asking for the 	
		  item's serial number or name. Then a second window will pop-up, where you can edit 
		  the serial number, name, and/or value. Hit enter and the changes will be done. 

	5.) Sort: This button sorts the list by serial number, name, or value. A window will pop-up
		 asking for which option you will like. Once you make a selection, you will view the
		 list sorted accordingly. 

	6.) Search Bar: You can search by typing either an item's serial number or name. Will be 	
		        displayed in the the list window.

	7.) Save: This button allows you to save the list to a file. It will prompt you for the name
		 of the file. Then it will ask which format would you like the file to be in: TSV, 	
		 HTML, or JSON.
